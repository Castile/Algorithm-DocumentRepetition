比对结果：
algorithm is   an effective method that can     be    expressed within                    a finite amount of space and     time       and    in         a         well   defined formal      language for calculating a      function 
starting  from an initial   state  and  initial input when      executed proceeds through a finite number of well  defined successive states eventually producing output and     terminating at       a   final       ending state

比对结果：
programming languages are     primarily intended for expressing algorithms in     a form                           that can    be executed  by  a       computer but  are often    used as   a   way     to define or  document algorithms 
a           simpler   variant of        divide   and conquer    is         called a decrease and conquer algorithm that solves an identical sub problem and      uses the solution of   this sub problem to solve  the bigger   problem
